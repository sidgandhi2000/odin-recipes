        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a garlic naan recipe taken from Hebbar's Kitchen.</p>
        <p>It is one of my favourite breads to eat shahi paneer with.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>General ingredients:</p>
        <ul class="lists">
            <li>2 cup maida / plain flour</li>
            <li>¼ tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>¾ tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup curd / yogurt</li>
            <li>1 tsp garlic, grated</li>
            <li>water, for kneading</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the garlic butter:</p>
        <ul class="lists">
            <li>3 tbsp butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 tsp garlic, grated</li>
            <li>2 tbsp coriander, finely chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol class="lists">
            <li>firstly, in a large mixing bowl take 2 cup maida, ¼ tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder and ¾ tsp salt. mix well.</li>
            <li>add 2 tbsp oil, ¼ cup curd and 1 tsp garlic.</li>
            <li>mix well making sure everything is well combined.</li>
            <li>further, add water as required and knead to a smooth and soft dough.</li>
            <li>grease the dough with oil, cover and rest for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>meanwhile prepare garlic butter by mixing 3 tbsp butter, 1 tsp garlic and 2 tbsp coriander.</li>
            <li>after 2 hours, knead the dough slightly. to remove if any air present in the dough. pinch a ball sized dough.</li>
            <li>gently roll to oval shape using a rolling pin. make sure you do not make too thin nor thick. and also keep the size in mind. it should not be larger than your tawa size.</li>
            <li>grease with water over naan. make sure you coat uniformly. this helps naan to stick on tawa.</li>
            <li>furthermore, slowly flip over and put it on hot tawa. remember, be gentle and put the water coated side down to tawa. also do not use nonstick tawa.</li>
            <li>slightly press. this helps the naan to stick on to the tawa and when you flip the tawa upside down it will be intact.</li>
            <li>now after a minute, flip the tawa upside down and cook naan directly on flame till they turn golden brown.</li>
            <li>also brush with some prepared garlic butter mixed with coriander leaves.</li>
            <li>gently scrape the naan from the bottom and remove.</li>
            <li>finally, serve garlic naan hot with your favourite curry like mattar paneer.</li>
